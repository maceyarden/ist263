    <h2>Personal Info</h2>

    <p>
      I'm currently an undergraduate student at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public
      Communications at Syracuse University, majoring in <strong>Public Relations</strong>
      and minoring in Information Management and Technology through the School of
      Information Studies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Combining the skills I'm learning in both the iSchool and Newhouse has helped
      me grow as a well-rounded individual. Skills such as Photoshop, website
      development, and communication strategy have helped me further achieve my
      professional goals. Outside school, I enjoy traveling and trying new foods.
