                Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, majoring in <strong> PUblic Relations</strong> and minoring in Information Management and Technology through the School of Information Studies.</p> 

                <p>Combining the skills I am learning in both the ISchool and Newhouse has helped me grow and become a more well-rounded individual. Skills such as photoshop, website development, and general communication skills have helped me further achieve my goals as a professional. Outside of school, I enjoy trying new foods and traveling. I also value time with friends and family as much as possible.</p>
