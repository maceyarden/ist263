                Macey Arden
Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, majoring in Public Relations and minoring in Information Management and Technology through the School of Information Studies. Combining the skills I am learning in both the ISchool and Newhouse has helped me grow and become a more well-rounded individual. Skills such as photoshop, website development, and general communication skills have helped me further achieve my goals as a professional. Outside of school, I enjoy trying new foods and traveling. I also value time with friends and family as much as possible.
