      <h1>Sinclair Broadcast Group hit by ransomware attack, upending local TV newscasts</h1>

    <div class="main">
      <p>Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI), one of the largest TV station operators in the US, said Monday that a ransomware incident is disrupting some of its office and operational networks.</p>

      <p>The unidentified hackers also stole data from Sinclair's network; the company said it was working to determine what information was taken. Sinclair said it had notified law enforcement and US government agencies and was working to "restore operations quickly and securely."</p>

      <p>Sinclair CEO Chris Ripley repeated the statement at Monday afternoon's town hall and fielded questions from staffers, but had little concrete information to share.</p>

      <p>Sinclair is responsible for 185 television stations in 86 markets, including several regional sports networks. The company said its stations are still on the air and continuing to show national and syndicated programming like talk shows and sitcoms, but local live programming has been disrupted.</p>

      <p>Some stations struggled to produce newscasts on Sunday without access to writing, editing, or scheduling software.</p>

      <p>“All we are told right now is that we have technical difficulties,” one Sinclair journalist told CNN Sunday night.</p>

      <p>Ransomware — malicious software that locks computer networks until victims pay a fee — has been a threat to U.S. businesses for years. It became a national security focus after a series of ransomware incidents disrupted critical infrastructure this year.</p>

      <p>Australia’s 9 News network and several U.S. Cox Media Group stations experienced similar incidents earlier this year.</p>
