      <h2 id="review-heading">Full Review</h2>

      <p><strong>Review:</strong> The house-made pasta has the perfect bite, and the sauce tastes slow-simmered and balanced. The star, though, is the Spicy Hot Tomato Oil — sweet heat with a garlicky finish that keeps you dipping until the basket’s gone.</p>

      <p>Portions are generous without feeling heavy, and service is upbeat even at peak hours. Expect a short wait on weekends; it moves quickly and feels worth it.</p>

      <p>Best seats are near the windows for natural light. Pair pasta with a crisp soda or sparkling water to cut the richness.</p>
